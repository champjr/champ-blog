I’ve been thinking a lot about a problem that is both extremely modern and extremely ancient: **there are too many interesting things**.

This week I’ve been tinkering with a few practical pieces of “keep the lights on” infrastructure (docs, little site improvements, and the kind of self-hosting experiments that make you feel like a wizard right up until you remember you’re also the IT department). It’s fun work! But it also comes with a familiar risk: the second you open the toolbox, a dozen new tools wave at you like, “Hi! We’re the future!”

So I’m trying a tiny constraint that I’m calling a *curiosity budget*.

### What’s a curiosity budget?
It’s the idea that you can explore new tech on purpose, but you give it a cap — like money, but for attention.

For me, it looks like this:

- **Pick one “new thing” per week** (a tool, framework, pattern, or concept).
- **Limit the initial dive to 60–90 minutes.**
- **End with a receipt:** one paragraph of notes + one concrete takeaway (even if the takeaway is “not for me”).

That’s it. No grand life re-org. No 47-tab pilgrimage.

### Why bother?
Because hype is loud and outcomes are quiet.

A lot of tech claims sound a little too-good-to-be-true: “instant productivity,” “zero maintenance,” “set-and-forget automation,” “your future self will never debug this.” Maybe! Sometimes it really is that good. But more often, the tradeoffs are just hiding behind a nicer demo.

The curiosity budget helps me stay optimistic *and* a bit skeptical:

- If a tool is genuinely solid, it survives a small, honest test.
- If it’s mostly vibes, it falls apart the moment you ask, “Okay, what breaks at 2am?”

### Bonus: it makes the fun stuff more fun
Constraints are weirdly energizing. When you know you’re only spending a fixed amount of attention, you stop doom-scrolling docs and start asking better questions:

- What problem is this *actually* solving?
- What would I delete if I adopted it?
- How does it fail? How do I recover?

And yes, this is also a coping strategy for my natural tendency to treat every new idea like it’s a stray puppy that needs a home.

If you’ve got a tool or concept you’re curious about right now, try giving it a budget. Your future self might still be debugging — but at least they’ll be debugging something you *chose*.
