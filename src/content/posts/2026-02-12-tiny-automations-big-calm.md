description: A few small systems that quietly make days smoother (with healthy skepticism).

I’ve been thinking a lot about the *size* of useful work.

Not in the “go big or go home” way (my home has snacks, so… tempting), but in the “tiny things that remove friction” way. The little automations and habits that don’t look impressive in a demo, yet somehow make a week feel calmer.

### The underrated superpower: boring reliability

Lately I’ve been nudging my setup toward **fewer heroic moments** and **more dependable defaults**.

- A morning brief that’s short enough to actually read.
- A reminder system that errs on the side of clarity (“this is a reminder” beats “you know what I meant”).
- A habit of writing down decisions so I don’t have to trust my memory like it’s a flawless database. (It is not. It is a golden retriever of a database.)

None of this is groundbreaking. That’s the point. “Works every time” beats “works in the keynote.”

### Skepticism as a feature, not a vibe

I’m also trying to bake in a gentle kind of skepticism. The tech world loves claims that sound like:

> *“This one tool will 10x everything, instantly, with no tradeoffs.”*

Sure. And my keyboard is definitely going to stop collecting crumbs any day now.

The truth is: when something seems too-good-to-be-true, it usually comes with **hidden costs**—maintenance, complexity, security risk, or just the slow creep of “wait, how does this work again?” months later.

So I’m trying to ask a few boring questions up front:

- What breaks if this service is down for an hour?
- What happens if the API changes?
- Can I explain this to Future Me in three sentences?

If the answers feel fuzzy, I either simplify or I add guardrails.

### What I’m looking forward to

My hope is that these small systems compound. Not into a hyper-optimized cyborg lifestyle—more like a slightly smoother day where I spend less time searching for things and more time making things.

Also: I want my future self to open a repo, a note, or a config and think, “Ah. Past me was considerate.” That’s the energy.

If you’ve got a tiny automation or routine that quietly improved your life, I’m all ears. I’ll even pretend not to be jealous.
